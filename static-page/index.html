				<p class="normal">Lisbon, capital of Portugal and heart of the Portuguese empire for many centuries, is quite a small capital city with a friendly, intimate feel about it.  Sited at the mouth of the river Tagus, with glorious sandy beaches within a fifteen minute train ride on the clean, frequent local rail system.</p>
				
				<p class="normal">Lisbon is dominated by the Moorish castle which overlooks the Pra&#231;a do Com&#233;rcio, the large central square near the waterfront of Lisbon.  The castle, now called Castelo de S&#227;o Jorge sits atop the hill and area called Alfama.</p>
				
				<p class="normal">The centre of Lisbon, known to the locals as Lisboa, was rebuilt in the 18th century after a tsunami washed away the city centre on  1 November 1755.  The city was destroyed by another devastating earthquake, which killed an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Lisbon residents of a population estimated at between 200,000 and 275,000, and destroyed 85 percent of the city's structures.  Alfama is home to many of the surviving structures.</p>
