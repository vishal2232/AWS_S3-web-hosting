					<td class="col">Alfama is famous as the area where the last Moorish houses and small, twisting lanes exist and is also where youâ€™ll find a large number of the Fado bars of Lisbon.  Fado is the soulful, melancholic folk music of Portugal, a combination of strong voice and Guitarra Portuguesa.</td>
					<td>Lisbon is renowned for the azulejos, the blue and white tiles that adorn many of the older buildings.  Tiled houses often have ornate doors, some wrought iron and others of beautifully carved wood.</td>
					<td>Lisbon has been the setting-off point for many historical voyages, including those of Vasco De Gama, and the area of Bel&#233;m has a tower to commemorate the trip, as well as the remarkable Jer&#243;nimos Monastery.</td>
